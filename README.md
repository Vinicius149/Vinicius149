# Starting my IT journey!

I am embarking on a new journey of studying Information Technology. Since i was a kid, i have always been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to transform the world we live in.

I work as a Police Officer since 2015 and started to study "System Analisys and Development" in SENAC on 2021.

Currently i'm studying JAVA, C#, and some Database basics (MySQL) and excited to learn more about coding, databases and cybersecurity. It's going to be challenging, but I am ready to work hard and gain the skills and knowledge needed to excel in this field!

Have a good day!
